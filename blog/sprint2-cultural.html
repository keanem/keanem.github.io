    <body>When considering how I learn I must figure out what is conducive to a productive mindset. which is a calm environment with some jazz or other instrumentals to help keep me level headed when facing problems. I'm pretty unsure about my long term goals but having knowledge on web development puts me in a position where ill have a larger market to sell myself to, or just more skills to help in the family business. I feel like my human skills have been put to the test many, many times over but I can see myself yearning to listen more effectively. Sine there are plenty of situations where I loose myself for a second then the conversation slips away. I plan to have set breaks inbetween work sessions, otherwise i see this huge task in front of me that im unable to break into smaller parts and I try and take to big of a bite than I can handle. Any help needed will quickly have me referncing slack or contacting my facilitator,and all I expect form the team is openness and willingness to help which it has been made very apparent that they are. Rgiht now there are no scheduling conflicts in my life so this takes precedence.
