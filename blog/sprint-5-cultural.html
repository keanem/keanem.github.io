            </div>

            <div>
                 <h3>What surprised me the most about learning core is... </h3>
                    <p> 
                        I thought I had a fairly good grasp on many of these concepts but I was still able to learn. 
                        Being prepared initially with the information on mindset and how you can actually open yourself 
                        up to learn anything has really helped me through this process. I’ve been struggling more and more 
                        since week three (although I had a real panic doing week one at first, not GitHub is my friend ha!) 
                        and being able to go back to that idea that I can and will get it (eventually) is very grounding.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div> 
                <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                     <p> 
                        That I can be very hard on myself without knowing it. I guess it's ego that makes me feel 
                        like I should be able to understand something perfectly (by now) before I can move on and 
                        even attempt the next problem. This was really hard for me over the week 5 content because 
                        I had a mental battle to really work through first and this has stopped me from actually putting 
                        code down or just trying to see what I could achieve. I keep having to remind myself that, 
                        yes you don’t know everything, how could you? It’s been three weeks! But that doesn’t mean 
                        you can’t attempt something. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Also asking for help makes me feel a bit silly sometimes or like I’ve not grasped something enough. 
                        Like I should know it before asking for help. Learning code or any new language is tough stuff.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div> 
                    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                         <p> 
                            To know who you are, how you learn, how you react under pressure or in tough situations 
                            is a great skill to have because then you can recognize when you are getting to in your head. 
                            This helps you to recognize what sort of help or assistance you might need to push yourself 
                            forward. Being able to understand these things about yourself also helps you to become more aware 
                            of those around you. Being able to have empathy for others who are struggling with something 
                            you went through, or just being able to recognize that someone needs an ear is so helpful. 
                            It also give you the ability to talk something through (potentially) and come up with a team solution. 
                         </p>
                 </div>
                 <div> 
                    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                         <p> 
                            How much I enjoyed it.
                         </p>
                 </div>
                 <div> 
                    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                         <p> 
                            At the beginning asking friends/family about who they think I am 
                            (strengths, weaknesses) was a bit uncomfortable for me haha. But it 
                            helped me to take a look in at myself and know that the journey I was 
                            about to undertake I could do it even if I was going to struggle through it.
                         </p>
                 </div>
                 <div> 
                    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                         <p> 
                            You can’t put a price on being aware, understanding, and genuinely helpful and 
                            empathetic to those around you. Also, checking your ego now will save you in a work 
                            environment (if you haven’t already gone through this process). Not everyone grows up 
                            in an environment where these values are upheld or taught and to have it be a part of a 
                            learning environment that you are going through along with your peers is great.
                         </p>
                 </div>
                 <div> 
                    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                         <p> 
                            I don’t think it was a waste. To be honest this should be something that is a part of every 
                            level of learning to help build more well rounded humans. I do wish I had more time with the 
                            basics of code though but that’s for a different time.
                         </p>

                  <h3> Core 5 Part 2 - Reflecting On Your Learning</h3>
                       <p> 
                        My short term goal is to be able to actually grasp JavaScript by the end of this course 
                        to the point where I could teach someone. At the moment I am still learning and struggling 
                        through the concepts and being able to put them together to make code work.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        My long term goal is to gain enough skills that I could either combine code with my current 
                        field or move into an entirely different field. I would like the opportunity to be able to 
                        work from home and to have clients on the side as some extra income. I do not have an industry 
                        in mind at the moment that I am wanting to get into but we’ll see. I might freelance or get a 
                        company job. I am hoping to have the ability to have more flexibility in my life by upskilling. 
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Strengths - communicating and seeing the big picture. I can organise, plan and delegate.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Limitations - technically getting it all together (the “how do we make this work?”). 
                        I still feel like I am running before I can walk. Mentally sometimes I am finding that I am 
                        limiting myself before exhausting all of my options on certain tasks. I am hoping that being 
                        in a classroom/team environment will help more with my learning because I can talk to people 
                        face to face.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Staying on top of the material and keeping focused for 9 weeks will be a challenge for me 
                        I think. It will be interesting to come back to this at the end of the bootcamp to reflect 
                        on how I did. This might be something that I find I need to do further work at the end of the 
                        course before reaching out for a job, I don’t know. For me I know I have a hard time moving 
                        forward before I understand what I just did and that is something that I am finding that I am 
                        struggling with in foundations and will have to work on during bootcamp. I will also ask the 
                        same question 10 times until I get it.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Communication, pairing, presenting, further developing my leadership skills, giving and 
                        receiving feedback and being consistent with my reflective skills. Everything 
                        there is really important to keep developing and improving for me. I don’t think these 
                        are skills anyone ever ‘masters’ because you can always work on other ways to improve 
                        yourself and therefore be a more effective person to work with. Also just working on how 
                        to change my approach to work with whomever I am with. Sometimes you have to change up your 
                        style or communication to work with others so being able to understand how someone works 
                        before we deep dive into a task together will be key for me I think.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I expect to finish the course with more confidence than I do now.
                        Making sure I am reflective, especially on the things I don’t 
                        understand fully so I can make sure to seek help in those areas.
                        Sleep enough and drink water, eat healthy.
                        Having a 5 min meditation before and at the end of the day. 
                        I’ve also found that a mid-day session helps sometimes too if I am really wound up.
                        If you don’t understand something you need to do some research 
                        and then ask for help or an explanation. Stop just trying to work 
                        through it on your own. This means dropping your ego regularly.
                        Cry if you need to then start again.
